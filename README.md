# Option group control

For styling a group of radiobuttons or checkboxes in a snazzy and friendly way.

See the [option group control demo page](http://ceefourbee.github.io/option-group-control/) for examples.

Read about how to use it and my trivial thought process on my blog: [CeeFourBee: Option group control](http://ceefourbee.co.uk/2014/07/web/a-control-for-options/).
